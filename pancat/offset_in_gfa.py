"""
Here, we aim to extend the current GFA tag format by adding tags
that do respect the GFA naming convention.
A JSON string, PO (Path Offset) positions, relative to paths.
Hence, PO:J:{'w1':[(334,335,'+')],'w2':[(245,247,'-')]} tells that the walk/path w1
contains the sequence starting at position 334 and ending at position 335,
and the walk/path w2 contains the sequence starting at the offset 245 (ending 247),
and that the sequences are reversed one to each other.
Note that any non-referenced walk in this field means that the node
is not inside the given walk.
